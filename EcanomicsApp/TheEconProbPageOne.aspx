	<center>How to best satisfy Infinite Desires using Limited Resources</center>
	<p style="color:white">Everyone has basic needs in life - e.g. food, water, roof over there head.<br />
		Everyone also has an infinite list of things they want - e.g. designer clothes, smartphones, holiday, house.<br />
		However, there's a limited amount of resources availabe to satisfy these needs and wants (scarce resources), which
		leads to the basic economic problem.		
	</p>
	<center>four factors of production</center>
	<p style="color:white">
		<h4>land which are the natural resources of the world which includes:</h4>
		<li>non-renewable resources - from natural gas to oil and coal</li>
		<li>renewable resources - wind or solar power (trees to some extent)</li>
		<li>Materials - diamonds and gold</li>
		<li>water</li>
		<li>animals - various different uses for animals (which will be talked about in a later topic).</li>
		<div style="color:white">Nearly all things that fall under the category of ‘land’ are scarce —
		there aren’t enough natural resources to satisfy the demands of everyone.</div>
		Air is an exception but due to high levels of pollution in larger cities, clean air can also be seen as
		scares in these siutation.<br />
		
		<h4>labour: The workforce of tomorrow, today</h4>
		1)Labour is the work done by those people who contribute to the production process.
		The population who are available to do work is called the labour force.<br />
		2)There’s usually also a number of people who are capable of working and who are old enough
		to work, but who don’t have a job. Economists refer to these people as unemployed.<br />
		3)There are also people who aren’t in paid employment but still provide things people need or want, e.g. homemakers.<br />
		4)Different people have different levels of education, experience or training. These factors can make some people
		more ‘valuable’ or productive in the workplace than others — they have a greater amount of human capital. <br />

		<h4>Capital used in producing goods and services</h4>
		1) Capital is the equipment, factories and schools that help to produce goods or services. <br />
		2) Capital is different from land because capital has to be made first. <br />
		3) Much of an economy’s capital is paid for by the government — e.g. a country’s road network is a form of capital. <br />
		<h4>Enterprise: willingness to take a risk to make a profit</h4>	
		Enterprise refers to the people (entrepreneurs) who take risks and create things from the other three factors of production.
		1) They set up and run businesses using any of the factors of production available to them.
		2) If the business fails, they can lose a lot of money. But if the business succeeds, the reward for their risk-taking is profit.
		
		<h4>Scarcity requires the careful allocation of Resources</h4>
		1) Economic activity involves combining the factors of production to create outputs that people can consume.
		The purpose of any economic activity is to increase people’s economic welfare by creating outputs that
		satisfy their various needs and wants.<br />
		2) In Economics a wide range of things count as economic activity.<br />
		3) One form of economic activity is the making of goods and the provision of services (i.e. creating outputs).<br />
		4) Consumption (i.e. buying or using) is also a form of economic activity. When you consume something, you’re trying to satisfy a need or a want. 
		You can consume both goods and services.<br /> 
		
		<h4>Economics Agents react to Incentivess</h4>
		1)The agents (‘participants’) in an economy can usually be thought of as:
		<li>Producers — firms or people that make goods or provide services.</li>
		<li>Consumers — people or firms who buy the goods and services.</li>
		<li>Governments — a government sets the rules that other participants in the economy
		have to follow, but also produces and consumes goods and services.</li>
		
		2)Each of these economic agents has to make decisions that affect how resources are allocated. For example:
		<li>Producers decide what to make, and how much they’re willing to sell it for.</li>
		<li>Consumers have to decide what they want to buy, and how much they’re willing to pay for it.</li>
		<li>Governments have to decide how much to intervene in the way producers and consumers act.</li>
		
		3) In a market economy (see page 10), all economic agents are assumed to be rational (see page 13), which means they’ll make the 
		decisions that are best for themselves. These decisions will be based on economic incentives, 
		such as making profit or paying as little as possible for a product.
		4) Considering people’s incentives helps to answer those fundamental questions above.
		<li>What to produce? This will be those goods that firms can make a profit from.</li>
		<li>How to produce it? Firms will want to produce the good in the most efficient way they can,
		in order to maximise their profits.</li>
		<li>Who to produce it for? Firms will produce goods for
		consumers who are willing to pay for those goods.</li>
